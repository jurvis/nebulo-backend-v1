### What Is It?
This is my first (tiny) web app written in Go. It uses goquery to scrape data from http://aqicn.org/ and stores is in a gkvlite persistent key-value store which can be accessed by the API layer to return a simple JSON response.

Will love to gather some feedback on how to improve this, so feel free to submit an issue and I'll be happy to learn!
